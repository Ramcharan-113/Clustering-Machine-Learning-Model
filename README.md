# Clustering-Machine-Learning-Model
This is Project on Building a machine learning model on the data set of HELP international humanitarian to classify the countries to which they should go funding first.
Based of various factors of countries such as death rate, disastar rate, child moternnity, etc the model should predict the countries by clustering them into required number of clusters.
So in this project I have used PCA (Principle Components Analysis) method or process to make the optimal dimensionality reduction of the variables.
And then I have build a clustering model using K-Means clustering drawn out the insights from the model of the country names which require high rate of priority.
I have also used other method of building clustering model which is known as Hierarchial Clustering which uses Dendrogram and Cut-tree method for clustering.
